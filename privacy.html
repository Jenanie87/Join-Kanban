                        <p class="margin-bottom-16px">The operators of these pages take the protection of your personal data very seriously. We treat your personal data confidentially and in accordance with the statutory data protection regulations and this privacy policy.<br />When
                            you use this website, various personal data is collected. Personal data is data with which you can be personally identified. This privacy policy explains what data we collect and what we use it for. It also explains how and
                            for what purpose this is done.<br />We would like to point out that data transmission over the internet (e.g., communication by e-mail) may have security gaps. A complete protection of data against access by third parties is
                            not possible.</p>
                        <h3>Information about the responsible party</h3>

                        <p class="margin-bottom-16px">The responsible party is the natural or legal person who alone or jointly with others decides on the purposes and means of processing personal data (e.g., names, email addresses, etc.).</p>
                        <h3>Storage duration</h3>
                        <p class="margin-bottom-16px">Unless a specific storage period is specified within this privacy policy, your personal data will remain stored with us until the purpose for processing the data no longer applies. If you assert a legitimate request for deletion
                            or revoke your consent to data processing, your data will be deleted unless we have other legally permissible reasons for storing your personal data (e.g., tax or commercial retention periods); in the latter case, the deletion
                            will take place after these reasons no longer apply.</p>
                        <h3>General information on the legal basis for data processing on this website</h3>
                        <p class="margin-bottom-16px">If you have given your consent to data processing, we process your personal data on the basis of Art. 6 (1) lit. a GDPR or Art. 9 (2) lit. a GDPR, if special categories of data according to Art. 9 (1) GDPR are processed. In the
                            case of express consent to the transfer of personal data to third countries, the processing is also based on Art. 49 (1) lit. a GDPR. If you have consented to the storage of cookies or access to information on your device (e.g.,
                            via device fingerprinting), the processing also takes place on the basis of &sect; 25 (1) TTDSG. Consent can be revoked at any time. If your data is required for the fulfillment of a contract or for the implementation of pre-contractual
                            measures, we process your data based on Art. 6 (1) lit. b GDPR. Furthermore, we process your data if necessary to fulfill a legal obligation based on Art. 6 (1) lit. c GDPR. Data processing may also be based on our legitimate
                            interests pursuant to Art. 6 (1) lit. f GDPR. The relevant legal bases in each individual case are provided in the following paragraphs of this privacy policy.</p>
                        <h3>Recipients of personal data</h3>
                        <p class="margin-bottom-16px">In the course of our business activities, we work with various external entities. This may require the transfer of personal data to these external entities. We only pass on personal data to external entities if it is necessary
                            for the fulfillment of a contract, if we are legally obligated to do so (e.g., disclosure of data to tax authorities), if we have a legitimate interest pursuant to Art. 6 (1) lit. f GDPR in the transfer, or if another legal
                            basis permits the transfer of data. When using data processors, we only transfer personal data of our customers on the basis of a valid contract for data processing. In the case of joint processing, a joint processing agreement
                            is concluded.</p>
                        <h3>Revocation of your consent to data processing</h3>
                        <p class="margin-bottom-16px">Many data processing operations are only possible with your express consent. You can revoke consent you have already given at any time. The legality of the data processing carried out before the revocation remains unaffected by
                            the revocation.</p>
                        <h3>Right to object to data collection in special cases and to direct advertising (Art. 21 GDPR)</h3>
                        <p class="margin-bottom-16px">If data processing is based on Art. 6 (1) lit. e or f GDPR, you have the right to object to the processing of your personal data for reasons that arise from your particular situation, including profiling based on these provisions.
                            The respective legal basis on which processing is based can be found in this privacy policy. If you object, we will no longer process your personal data unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing
                            that override your interests, rights, and freedoms or if the processing serves the assertion, exercise, or defense of legal claims (objection pursuant to Art. 21 (1) GDPR).<br />If your personal data is processed for direct
                            marketing purposes, you have the right to object at any time to the processing of your personal data for the purpose of such advertising, including profiling to the extent that it is related to such direct marketing. If you
                            object, your personal data will subsequently no longer be used for direct marketing purposes (objection pursuant to Art. 21 (2) GDPR).</p>
                        <h3>Right to lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority</h3>
                        <p class="margin-bottom-16px">In the event of violations of the GDPR, data subjects have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in the member state of their habitual residence, place of work, or place of the alleged infringement.
                            This right to lodge a complaint is without prejudice to other administrative or judicial remedies.</p>
                        <h3>Right to data portability</h3>
                        <p class="margin-bottom-16px">You have the right to have data that we process automatically on the basis of your consent or in fulfillment of a contract handed over to you or to a third party in a standard, machine-readable format. If you request the direct
                            transfer of the data to another responsible party, this will only be done to the extent that it is technically feasible.</p>
                        <h3>Information, correction, and deletion</h3>
                        <p class="margin-bottom-16px">Within the framework of the applicable legal provisions, you have the right to free information about your stored personal data, its origin and recipient, and the purpose of data processing at any time. You also have the right
                            to correct or delete this data. For this purpose and for further questions regarding personal data, you can contact us at any time.</p>
                        <h3>Right to restriction of processing</h3>
                        <p class="margin-bottom-16px">You have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data. You can contact us at any time for this purpose. The right to restrict processing exists in the following cases:<br />If you dispute the accuracy
                            of your personal data stored by us, we usually need time to verify this. For the duration of the examination, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.<br />If the processing of
                            your personal data was/is unlawful, you can request the restriction of data processing instead of deletion.<br />If we no longer need your personal data, but you need it for the exercise, defense, or assertion of legal claims,
                            you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data instead of deletion.<br />If you have filed an objection pursuant to Art. 21 (1) GDPR, a balance must be struck between your interests and
                            ours. As long as it is not yet clear whose interests prevail, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.<br />If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, this data
                            &ndash; apart from its storage &ndash; may only be processed with your consent or for the assertion, exercise, or defense of legal claims or for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons
                            of important public interest of the European Union or a member state.</p>
