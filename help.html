                            <p class="margin-bottom-16px">Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards. Cards represent individual tasks.

                            <p class="margin-bottom-16px">As the task moves from one stage to another, you can reflect that on the board by dragging and dropping the card from one list to another.</p>
